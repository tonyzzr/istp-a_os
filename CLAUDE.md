# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains documentation for the **ISTP-A Behavioral Operating System (BOS)**, a personal productivity methodology designed specifically for ISTP-A personality types. The system is documented entirely in Chinese.

## Document Structure

The primary document is `ISTP-A_Manual_v3_full.pdf`, which covers:

1. **Core Cognitive Model**: Ti (Introverted Thinking), Se (Extroverted Sensing), Te (Extroverted Thinking) - their interactions and synergies
2. **BOS Framework**: Baseline → Structure → Modules → Pipeline → Entry Point → Snapshot
3. **Core Principles**: Action-first, clear boundaries, lightweight structure
4. **Priority OS**: Multi-task parallel management using 5 dimensions (Cost of Inaction, Dependency, Return/Leverage, Visibility, Friction)
5. **Case Studies**: Academic paper writing, code framework construction, job hunting, fitness, PhD thesis, immigration applications (EB1A/O1)

## Key Concepts

### The BOS Cycle
- **Baseline**: Get tasks running at minimum viable state (e.g., compilable skeleton, toy example)
- **Structure**: Establish clear boundaries and sections without over-engineering
- **Modules**: Break tasks into 20-40 minute executable chunks
- **Pipeline**: Weekly rhythm of advancing core modules
- **Entry Point**: Specific starting position for each work session
- **Snapshot**: Context capture at end of session (what was done + next specific step)

### Design Philosophy
- **Action Priority**: Start doing rather than extensive planning
- **Clear Boundaries**: Provide Ti with defined containers to prevent endless analysis
- **Lightweight Structure**: Sufficient scaffolding without becoming burdensome
- Designed to match ISTP cognitive patterns: Ti needs structure, Se needs immediate action, Te needs clear execution paths

## Working with This Repository

### If Adding Content
- Maintain Chinese language for consistency with existing documentation
- Follow the established framework terminology (Baseline, Structure, Modules, etc.)
- New case studies should follow the 6-component structure

### If Translating
- Preserve technical terms like "Ti", "Se", "Te", "BOS", "Priority OS"
- Maintain the systematic framework structure
- Keep case study format consistent

### If Implementing as Software
This methodology could be implemented as:
- Task management system with Snapshot functionality
- Project templating tool following BOS structure
- Priority OS calculator for multi-project management
- Module-based workflow automation

Any implementation should preserve the core principle: reduce cognitive overhead for action-oriented personalities who struggle with abstract long-term planning.
